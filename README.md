# Chronopost

Activating one or more of them will let your customers choose which one
they want.

Delivery types currently availables :

NB1 : You need IDs provided by Chronopost to use this module.

```

## Usage

Then go to Chronopost configuration page, tab "Advanced Configuration" and fill the required fields.

After activating the delivery types you wih to use, new tabs will appear. With these, you can
change the shipping prices according to the delivery type and the area, and/or activate free shipping for a given price and/or given area, or just

For relay / pickup points, you need to integrate a template to choose one relay in the list provided by the loop 'chronopost.pickup.point.get.relay'.
Ideally from a map, like google maps, yandex, or similar. 

Then, you can either create an entry in the address table and use it immediately,
or overload the thelia.order.delivery form to accept entire addresses as input instead of only an address id
from which to get the entire address.
